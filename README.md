  <h1>Dr. Semmelweis - The Discovery of Handwashing</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This repository contains data and analysis related to the groundbreaking discovery of handwashing by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>During the 19th century, Dr. Semmelweis noticed a significant difference in mortality rates between two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital. He observed that women giving birth in Clinic 1, where medical students conducted autopsies and then assisted in childbirth, had a much higher risk of developing childbed fever compared to women in Clinic 2, where midwives attended the births.</p>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <p>Dr. Semmelweis suspected that something on the hands of the medical students was responsible for the higher mortality rates. In a pioneering move, he implemented handwashing as a mandatory practice for the medical staff in Clinic 1. The results were astonishing.</p>
  <p>An analysis of the data collected by Dr. Semmelweis shows that the proportion of deaths due to childbed fever decreased significantly after the implementation of handwashing. The average reduction in mortality was estimated to be between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, with a 95% confidence interval.</p>

  <h2>Data and Analysis</h2>
  <p>This repository includes the datasets used by Dr. Semmelweis, as well as Python code for performing data analysis and generating visualizations. The analysis showcases the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.</p>
